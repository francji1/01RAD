        "The dataset is based on the **House Sales in King County, USA** dataset, which can be found, for example, on kaggle.com or in the `moderndive` library under the name `house_prices`. The original dataset contains house sale prices in the King County area, which includes Seattle, and the data was collected between May 2014 and May 2015. For our purposes, several variables have been removed, and the dataset has been significantly reduced and slightly modified.\n",
