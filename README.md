# Regression Data Analysis (01RAD)

Welcome to the repository for the **01RAD - Regression Data Analysis** course. This repository contains all the materials needed to follow along with the course, including assignments, code examples, and datasets.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **`assignments/`**  
  Contains the course assignments. Subfolders are organized by year (e.g., `2024/`) and include instructions and related materials.

- **`code/`**  
  Includes Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks demonstrating key concepts in regression analysis. The code is structured by topic or lecture.

- **`data/`**  
  This directory contains datasets used in the course for practice, assignments, and demonstrations. Each dataset includes a brief description.

## Course Overview

The **Regression Data Analysis** course provides a comprehensive introduction to the fundamentals and applications of regression analysis. Topics include:

1. Simple and multiple linear regression  
2. Assumptions of regression models and diagnostics  
3. Handling multicollinearity and model selection  
4. Transformations and interaction terms  
5. Applications in real-world scenarios  

### Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, students will:

- Understand the principles of regression analysis and its assumptions.  
- Be able to build, evaluate, and interpret regression models.  
- Learn how to diagnose and resolve common problems in regression.  
- Gain experience working with real-world data and applying regression techniques effectively.

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge (preferably Python).  
- A solid foundation in mathematics and statistics, including linear algebra and probability.
