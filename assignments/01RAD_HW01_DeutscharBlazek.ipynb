        " The histogram for residuals of houses with a fireplace appears roughly bell-shaped, but with deviation from the overlaid normal distribution.\n",
        " The histogram for residuals of houses without a fireplace also shows a distribution centered around zero, but it seems to deviate more noticeably from the normal distribution, particularly in the right tail, probably due to one outlier.\n",
        "\n",
        "The QQ plot of residuals of houses with a fireplace shows that most of the points generally follow the red reference line but with a wobble indicating that the residuals are probably not perfectly normally distributed.\n",
        "\n",
        "The QQ plot for residuals of houses without a fireplace shows more similar deviations from the red line, but they generally appear strongly bimodal. There is a great influence of the one said outlier.\n",
        "\n",
        "The diagnostics suggest that the assumption of normally distributed errors, which is a key assumption for standard linear regression inference might not hold perfectly and appears to be more problematic for the model without a fireplace, especially due to the presence of one particular outlier. The deviations from normality could affect the validity of the statistical tests and confidence intervals.\n",
        "\n",
        "Suggestions for Further Model Improvements:\n",
        "\n",
        "One obvious option is to further investigate the data points that appear as outliers in the residual plots. These might represent houses with unusual characteristics that are not captured by the current model.\n",
        "\n",
        "The current models only use 'living_area' to predict 'price'. Using other relevant variables (like 'bathrooms', 'age' or 'lot_size') could help explain more of the variance in price and potentially improve the residual distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "While not asked for in this task, it's important to also check for homoscedasticity. If the variance of residuals changes with the predicted value or independent variable, it violates another assumption of linear regression and might require weighted least squares or transformations."
